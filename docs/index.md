### What is this?

This is a template site for the most 'basic' of web applications. 
A complete deployment of this site includes an application server and
a database server. The application server references one database throughout
its lifetime. this architechure does NOT implement 
[Multitenancy/Multi-Instance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitenancy).
It is the prototypical "web apps 101".

TODO: IMAGE.


### Goals

I'd like to build something that is as self documenting as possible and
amenable to extension (i.e. new features) through tooling.
